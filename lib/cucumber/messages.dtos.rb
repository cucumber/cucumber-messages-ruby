    # Represents the Attachment message in Cucumber's {message protocol}[https://github.com/cucumber/common/tree/main/messages#readme].
    #
    # //// Attachments (parse errors, execution errors, screenshots, links...)
    # 
    # *
    #  An attachment represents any kind of data associated with a line in a
    #  [Source](#io.cucumber.messages.Source) file. It can be used for:
    # 
    #  * Syntax errors during parse time
    #  * Screenshots captured and attached during execution
    #  * Logs captured and attached during execution
    # 
    #  It is not to be used for runtime errors raised/thrown during execution. This
    #  is captured in `TestResult`.
    #
    # The code was auto-generated by {this script}[https://github.com/cucumber/common/blob/main/messages/jsonschema/scripts/codegen.rb]

      #  is simply the string. If it's `BASE64`, the string should be Base64 decoded to
      #  obtain the attachment.

      attr_reader :body

      ##

      #  Whether to interpret `body` "as-is" (IDENTITY) or if it needs to be Base64-decoded (BASE64).
      # 
      #  Content encoding is *not* determined by the media type, but rather by the type
      #  of the object being attached:

      #  - byte array => BASE64

      #  It should be set by a program that reads a message stream and does the following for
      #  each Attachment message:
      # 
      #  - Writes the body (after base64 decoding if necessary) to a new file.
      #  - Sets `body` and `contentEncoding` to `null`
      #  - Writes out the new attachment message
      # 
      #  This will result in a smaller message stream, which can improve performance and
      #  reduce bandwidth of message consumers. It also makes it easier to process and download attachments
      #  separately from reports.
